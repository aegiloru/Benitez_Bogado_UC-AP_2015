Title: Development of an UAV prototype for visual inspection of aerial electrical lines

Published in: 2016 Seventh Argentine Conference on Embedded Systems (CASE)

Abstract:
The development of an attitude and altitude control system of an unmanned aerial vehicle for visual inspection 
of aerial electrical lines is presented. 
The system was implemented using quaternions algebra and the altimeter equation for the orientation estimation 
with the purpose of controlling the quad- copter. 
The proposed system was simulated in Matlab using a Newton-Euler model and compared with the performance on a
real prototype operation, obtaining similar results in both cases.

Keywords:
aerial electrical lines, visual inspection, quadrotor, control theory, quaternions.
